2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell cpu_mem/memory/alu_op_in_reg[0]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) cpu_mem/cpu/pc/pc_reg[0]/CLR, cpu_mem/cpu/pc/pc_reg[10]/CLR, cpu_mem/cpu/pc/pc_reg[11]/CLR, cpu_mem/cpu/pc/pc_reg[12]/CLR, cpu_mem/cpu/pc/pc_reg[13]/CLR, cpu_mem/cpu/pc/pc_reg[14]/CLR, cpu_mem/cpu/pc/pc_reg[15]/CLR, cpu_mem/cpu/pc/pc_reg[1]/CLR, cpu_mem/cpu/pc/pc_reg[2]/CLR, cpu_mem/cpu/pc/pc_reg[3]/CLR, cpu_mem/cpu/pc/pc_reg[4]/CLR, cpu_mem/cpu/pc/pc_reg[5]/CLR, cpu_mem/cpu/pc/pc_reg[6]/CLR, cpu_mem/cpu/pc/pc_reg[7]/CLR, cpu_mem/cpu/pc/pc_reg[8]/CLR (the first 15 of 274 listed).
